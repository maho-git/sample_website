    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

        <p>
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
          technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
          command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
          everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
          Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
          We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
          learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
